<h1>EA Is Not Dangerous — Misuse Is</h1>

<p>
Expert Advisors (EA) are often misunderstood.
They are neither inherently profitable nor inherently dangerous.
</p>

<p>
EA are decision-making systems.
When deployed, they replace human discretion with predefined logic.
The real risk emerges not from the system itself,
but from how humans delegate responsibility to it.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Automation Does Not Remove Risk — It Reshapes It</h2>

<p>
Automation does not eliminate uncertainty.
It transforms visible, emotional risk into delayed, structural risk.
</p>

<p>
When market conditions change,
EA continue to operate according to the same logic.
Without contextual awareness,
this consistency becomes fragility.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Most EA Failures Are Human Failures</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unrealistic expectations of consistency</li>
  <li>Misunderstanding drawdown as tolerance instead of information</li>
  <li>Delegating responsibility without understanding constraints</li>
  <li>Absence of system-level oversight</li>
</ul>

<p>
EA do not fail suddenly.
They fail when their operating assumptions silently expire.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Role of a System-Aware IB</h2>

<p>
A system-aware Introducing Broker (IB) does not promise returns.
The role is not performance enhancement,
but risk contextualization.
</p>

<p>
<strong>bugtraderyai</strong> operates as a system-aware IB,
focusing on how EA interact with market regimes,
human psychology,
and risk exposure over time.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>This Website Is Not a Sales Platform</h2>

<p>
This site exists to document a system-level understanding of EA.
It is not designed to convince,
but to clarify.
</p>

<p>
Those who seek certainty may find discomfort here.
Those who seek understanding may find alignment.
</p>
